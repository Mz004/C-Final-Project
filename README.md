# Basic patient(pet) appointment system for a veterinary clinic

# Overview:
This Project has been broken down into critical deadlines called milestones. Implementing projectsusing milestones will help you stay on target with respect to timelines and balancing out the workload. By the end of milestone #3, you will have created a basic patient (pet) appointment system for a veterinaryclinic. Patient contact information will be managed as well as the scheduling and management of appointments. Each milestone will build upon the previous, adding more functionality and components. Milestone #1 is focused on providing helper functions that will aid you in the development of the overall solution in future milestones. These functions will streamline your logic and simplify the overall readability and maintainability of your program by providing you with established routines that have been thoroughly tested for reliability and eliminate unnecessary code redundancy (so use them whenever possible and don't duplicate logic already done).

# Milestone – 1:
This milestone includes a unit tester (a1ms1.c). A unit tester is a program which invokes your functions, passing them known parameter values. It then compares the results returned by your functions with the correct results to determine if your functions are working correctly. The tester should be used to confirm your solution meets the specifications for each “helper” function. The helper functions should be thoroughly tested and fail-proof (100% reliable) as they will be used throughout your assignment milestones. 

# Milestone – 2:
This milestone comes with a starting framework for the veterinary clinic system (the menu system and basic display functions). Although a lot of code is already provided for you, there are still many functions you will need to define. Milestone-2 focuses on the management of the clinic's "patients" which are the records representing the family pets. You will need to create some data structures along with several functions that will be responsible for carrying out menu selections which perform specific tasks in the managing of patient data. A new module "clinic" is now required which will be used to organize all the clinic-centric components and where you will be placing most of your remaining work.

# Milestone – 3:
This milestone completes the veterinary clinic system with the addition of appointment management functionality and the importing of patient and appointment information from data text files. You will need to create additional data structures along with several functions that will be responsible for carrying out the new appointment management menu options that perform specific tasks in the management of appointment data.

# Specifications:
Milestone-1 will establish the function “helpers” we will draw from as needed throughout the three milestones. These functions will handle routines that are commonly performed (greatly reduces code redundancy) and rovide assurance they accomplish what is expected without fail (must be reliable).

It is important to note that this code will not compile until you copy your work from Milestone-1 into the files for Milestone-2, create some new data types, and define the remaining uncoded function definitions.

Like Milestone-2, it is important to note that this code will not compile until you copy your work from Milestone-2 into the provided files for Milestone-3. You will also need to create some new data types, as
well as define the mandatory uncoded function prototypes and definitions that are new to Milestone-3.

Three clinic module/library functions have been completely supplied for you: "displayScheduleHeader", "displayScheduleData", and "menuAppointment", along with two function prototypes: "importPatients" and "importAppointments" (responsible for data import). These functions provide you with the necessary framework to get started in this final milestone. In this milestone, it is expected you will create additional functions as you see fit to help you get the job done. It is also expected you will follow and adhere to the structured design principles.
